# Project-ring-decoder
My Second Project,

In this project I have created three various ways to scramble and use secret messages that are able to encode and decode those messages.
The first function, Caesar(),
<ul>takes in a message and shifts an inputted alphabet in a + or - direction,</ul>
<ul>after the shift occurs, substitute the characters assosciated with its placement,</ul>
<ul>return scrambled work associated with the shift in alphabet</ul>

The Second function, Polybius(),
<ul>takes in a message and pairs a set of numbers associated to the individual letter,</ul>
<joins the numbered pair to return a list of paired numbers together,</ul>

The Third funciton, Substitution(),
<ul>takes in a message and new alphabet,</ul>
<ul>checks to see if the inserted alphabet is valid,</ul>
<ul>replaces the letters associated with the characters used from the inputted alphabet,</ul>
<ul>returns a new scrambled message using inputted alphabet</ul>

These functions can be found <a href="https://github.com/JoseSilvoza/Project-ring-decoder/tree/master/src"><p>here</p>
